        <p>
          My name is Ambroise Loiseau,
          I am a junior web developer trained at school 42, and I'm excited to share with you my
          projects and skills in this field. Although I don't have much experience in creating websites, I already have
          worked
          on a project in collaboration with other School 42 students that allowed me to develop my programming and
          web design skills.
          In this portfolio, you will find examples of some of my project and details about my
          technical skills and work experiences. I'm looking forward to sharing my projects with you and learning more about
          opportunities to collaborate together.
